  <h2>Cyber Security</h2>
  <p>As the world embraces computers more and more, we'll need more and more people
  to keep us safe in the computing world. Where to start learning Cyber Security depends on how much prior programming
  knowledge you have. The list of resources assumes you start from 0.
  If not, feel free to look further down the list for more advanced resources.</p>

      <h3>Python</h3>
      <p>I recommend picking up Python as a first programming language,
      it's simple to understand yet is extremely useful. Python will also teach you
      how to program without having to worry too much about syntax and/or other quirks
      of more complex programming languages.</p>

      alt="C logo" class="logo" height="100" width="100">
      <h3>C</h3>
      <p>C is a more advanced programming language. It's almost 50 years old but
      it's the father of a lot of other modern programming languages.
      It's also an excellent language to learn more advanced programming concepts such as memory management.
      Learning C will certainly give you the necessary skills to learn new languages much more easily.</p>

      <h3>Hacking Fundamentals</h3>
      <p>Now that you know how to program, let's do something with it.
      The big difference between people that can hack, and script kiddies (unskilled "hackers"),
      is that hackers make their own tools, script kiddies simply uses them.
      Therefore it is essential that you learn the fundamentals of hacking first.</p>

      <h3>Advanced Hacking</h3>
      <p>After learning the fundamentals you'll probably have a good idea of what you would like to learn next.
      If not Hacking the Hacker is a good book to give you a short, high level view of the security industry.
      Black Hat Python will teach you how to use the python skills you learned in the first section to hack more advanced systems.
      I found Car Security to be an interesting topic to pursue, if you're also interested; check out the Car Hacker's Handbook.</p>
