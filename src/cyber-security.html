    <h2>I Don't Know Where to Start</h2>
    <p>Good idea! Where to start does depend on how much prior programming
      knowledge you have. The list of resources assumes you start from 0.
      If not, feel free to look further down the list from more advanced
      resources.</p>

        <h3>Python</h3>
        <p>I really recommend picking up Python as your first programming language,
        it's simple to understand yet is used a lot. It will allow you to learn
        how to program before having to worry too much about syntax and/or other quirks
        of the programming language.</p>

        <h3>C</h3>
        <p>C is a more advanced programming language. It's almost 50 years old but
        it's the father of a lot of other modern programming languages.
        It's an excellent language to learn more advanced programming concepts such as memory management.
        Learning it will also give you the necessary skills to learn new languages much more easily.</p>

        <h3>Hacking Fundamentals</h3>
        <p>Now that you know how to program, let's do something with it.
        The big difference between people that can hack, and script kiddies,
        is that hackers make the tools, everybody else simply uses them.
        Therefore it is essential that you learn the fundamentals first.</p>

        <h3>Advanced Hacking</h3>
        <p>After learning the fundamentals you'll probably have a good idea of what you want to learn next.
        If not Hacking the Hacker is a good book to give you some ideas,
        it'll also introduce you to a lot of the top cyber defenders in the industry.
        Black Hat Python will let you use the python skills you learned in the first section to hack more advanced systems.</p>
