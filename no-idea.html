  <h2>I Don't Know Where to Start</h2>
  <p>No idea where to start? No problem! The next sections will give you
  a general step by step process to learn programming.
  After you have gone through each of the steps,
  you will probably have a more specific idea of what you would like to do next.</p>

      <h3>Python</h3>
      <p>I really recommend picking up Python as your first programming language,
      it's simple to understand yet is used a lot. It'll allow you to learn
      how to program without having to worry too much about syntax and/or other quirks
      of the programming language.</p>

      <h3>C</h3>
      <p>C is a more advanced programming language. It's almost 50 years old but
      it's the father of a lot of other modern programming languages.
      It's an excellent language to learn more advanced programming concepts such as memory management.
      Learning it will also give you the necessary skills to learn new languages much more easily.</p>

      <h3>Object Oriented Programming</h3>
      <p>Object Oriented Programming is a kind of programming style that's used pretty much everywhere.
      It is a vital skill to learn for anybody that's interested in software engingeering.
      One can learn OOP in a variety of languages, Java, C++, Ruby to name a few.</p>
