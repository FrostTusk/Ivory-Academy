  <h2>I Don't Know Where to Start</h2>
  <p>No idea where to start? The next sections will give you a general step by step process to learn programming.
  After you have finished each of the steps, you'll probably have a more specific idea of what you would like to do next.</p>

      <h3>Python</h3>
      <p>I recommend picking up Python as a first programming language,
      it's simple to understand yet is extremely useful. Python will also teach you
      how to program without having to worry too much about syntax and/or other quirks
      of more complex programming languages.</p>

      <h3>C</h3>
      <p>C is a more advanced programming language. It's almost 50 years old but
      it's the father of a lot of other modern programming languages.
      It's also an excellent language to learn more advanced programming concepts such as memory management.
      Learning C will certainly give you the necessary skills to learn new languages much more easily.</p>

      <h3>Object Oriented Programming</h3>
      <p>Object Oriented Programming is a kind of programming style that's used pretty much everywhere.
      It's a vital skill to learn for anybody that's interested in software engingeering.
      One can learn OOP in a variety of languages, Java, C++, Ruby to name a few.</p>
